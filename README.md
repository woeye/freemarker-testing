# About

Freemarker doesn't provide a scope mechanism like JavaScript. But it does feature macros and locals. Here's a bit of code I used for playing around with macros and locals.

# Requirements

Requires maven in order to compile and run

# Getting started

Start the webserver with 

    mvn jetty:run
    
and point your webserver to 

    http://localhost:8080/freemarker-testing/test.ftl
